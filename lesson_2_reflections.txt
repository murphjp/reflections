1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It generates the .git directory. This creates a blank HEAD node that is where all future commits will be attached to.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The Staging area allow sus to signify what we would like to commit, it will allow us to add a commit with multiple files inside of it. if we used teh working diectory we would be adding all of the files so that wouldn't work either.
